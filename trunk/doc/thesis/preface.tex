% chapter overview
\begin{description}
\item[Chapter  1] The  first chapter  contains some  introductory material
  that  you  should read  if  you  are  not familiar  with  virtualization
  technologies and especially the \emph{\gls{glo:XEN} hyper visor}.
\item[Chapter   2]   This  chapter   deals   with   the   design  of   the
  \emph{\gls{glo:XEN}-based Execution Environment} and its components.
\item[Chapter  3]  The third  chapter  discusses  the  protocols used  for
  communication between the different  parts of the system.
\item[Chapter 4]  In this chapter  security related topics  are discussed,
  such  as securing  the messages  sent  between client  and server  using
  \emph{Message Layer Security} (\gls{glo:MLS}) or executing user-supplied
  scripts in a \emph{chroot environment}.
\item[Chapter   5]  This  chapter   shows  some   results  of   using  the
  \emph{\gls{glo:XEN}-based Execution  Environment} and compares  it against running
  the same programs on a stand-alone machine.
\item[Chapter 6] The final chapter draws some conclusions about the work
  that has been done and provides ideas for future development.
