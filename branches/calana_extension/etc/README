Generating Certificates
=======================

create a RSA key file:
	openssl genrsa -out <filename>.pem 2048
           generates a 2048 bit long RSA key into '<filename>.pem'
           store this file in a very secure location

create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):
	openssl req -new -key <filename>.pem -out <filename>.csr
	   generates the csr for the rsa-key in '<filename>.csr

transfer the .csr file to the CA:
	cp <filename>.csr /etc/CA/

Sign the CSR and generate the certificate:
==========================================
	cd /etc/CA
	make sign
	   this will sign each .csr file in the current directory

	transfer the created .cert file back to the requester
