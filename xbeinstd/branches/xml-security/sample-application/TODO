* finish the PingPong TestCase
	* add thread-safety to class PingPong
	* create on both sides: 
		- Channel, ChannelAdapter, PingPong Strategy with counting
		- Ping Event could look like:
			<message>
			  <header>...</header>
			  <body><tests-xbe:PingEvent/></body>
			</message>
		- Pong Event similar
		- PingPong should only send a fixed number of messages (ping part)
		- PingPong should await a fixed number of messages (pong part)
		- invariant: #msgs sent == #msgs received

	* TestCase must stop after a given time (i.e. channels and threads should be stopped)
	* test was successful if #pings == #pongs == #MessagesToSend
