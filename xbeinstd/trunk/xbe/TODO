XML-Security
============
        * missing: corrected version for the strategy decorators
        * missing: a nice way to load schema files
                - probably put that into XbeLibUtils somehow

Promela Model
=============
    * write a promela specification for the communication protocol between
      client and server and verify the results.

Mediator Pattern
================
    * introduce the mediator pattern for system events in the seda library
    * the xbe library subclasses the defined system-event-handler to handle
      library/application specific system-events
            - Strategies etc. may emit SystemEvents to the mediator
            - the mediator knows about these events and is linked to other
              objects that know what to do
                - example:
                    the application's state-machine wants to reconnect to the
                    message queue server, therefore the FSM provides
                    doReconnect() which sends a system event to the mediator,
                    which in turn forwards the event/transforms the event into
                    a command to the channel-adapter.

Observer Pattern
================

    * The MQS Channel should provide the ability to be observed by other objects
        * add an explicit state (connected, disconnected) that can be queried by observers
        * useful to notify the channel-adapter about state changes that did not throw an exception
